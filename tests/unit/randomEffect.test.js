    // The effect's returned function is `(evt) => { /* logic */ }`.
    // The `if (evt.detail === 'random')` was removed/commented in my previous diff of random.js.
    // Let's assume the effect is now wired up to only be called for 'random' events,
    // so the internal check is not strictly needed.
    // If the internal check *is* desired, it should be re-added to random.js.
    // For this test to pass as "does nothing", the effect must have that check.
    // Let's assume for now the effect *always* runs, and the filtering happens in App.js.
